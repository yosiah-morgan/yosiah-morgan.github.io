				<p>Treasure Island is a childhood adventure story. Despite the authority of the adult protagonists, their ineptitude almost leads to disaster at the hands of the pirates. Only the child, Jim is able to save the story and put things right. The story also deals with themes such as the futility of wealth and the end of adventure. I want the audience to watch the play with a sense of childlike wonder. I wanted to rearrange the set while the audience is watching to create a sense of whimsy. A revolve was used along with several flying scenic units. The stage is in a continuous state of change throughout the show as multiple locations are portrayed in the same spaces. These fluid transitions and saturated colors help to create a sense of magic and wonder which is key to the story.</p>
