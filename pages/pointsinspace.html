				<p><i>Points in Space</i> was developed for the Emerging Media Arts class Principles of Interactivity with Professor Anna Henson as an interactive VR installation exploring human embodiment. This installation intended to get people to explore the movement of their bodies in space. Using points in AR space combined with 3D audio effects, the audience is cued to the location of the next point. Once a point has been found, bringing the iPad close to the point triggers an audio effects and the next point is revealed. This installation builds on the body-space exploration present in Merce Cunningham’s <i>Points in Space</i> and Trisha Brown’s <i>Locus</i>. The title is borrowed from Cunningham however, the meaning is different. Merce Cunningham’s <i>Points in Space</i> comes from an Albert Einstein quote, “there are no fixed points in space.” In this work, the points are fixed while the human body moves around them; the body is not a fixed point in space. Through the audience’s exploration of the sculpture, they become aware of their bodies’ relative position to the fixed points within the sculpture. This work intends to have the audience examine their kinesthetic awareness through exploration of the sculpture. The audience almost dances through the installation as they move to find the various loci. As the audience interacts with a locus, it disappears and gives an audio clue to the next locus. The audience must be aware of their location relative to the sound to find the next locus. The points were randomly arranged by converting the string “embodiment and awareness” into a number sequence that was mapped onto Richard Serra’s Greenpoint sculpture. This is the same approach that Trisha Brown took in <i>Locus</i>, mapping the numbers onto a cube. Similarly to Brown’s work this sculpture explores the everyday movement of the body to bring about a greater sense of embodiment and awareness of self. Greenpoint was selected to house the sculpture because of its unique reverberation properties; sounds played on the iPad are louder and more clearly defined in 3D space. These audio cues are a powerful way of directing the audience to the next locus. The intended audience for this sculpture is students on campus and more broadly, people in the city of Lincoln. The points are arranged at staggered heights but remain within a close distance of the body to be accessible to as many people as possible. Furthermore, the design allows for deaf or blind audience members to participate because of the inclusion of both audio and visual cues. The installation was created using Adobe Aero, a VR software which allows 3D elements to be placed in space with customizable triggers. The triggers control which elements are visible and where sounds are played from. Ableton Live was used to create the audio effects. To best document the installation, video was taken from static cameras and the iPad before being edited together in Adobe Premier along with the audio samples. Unfortunately, this installation is not publicly available and therefor this footage was essential to documenting the work.</p>
